Project-Specific Rules & Guidelines
Support both Android and iOS platforms (use React Native or Flutter as per project stack).

Use weather APIs with a fallback option for reliability.

Ensure offline mode supports recent cached data.

Prioritize accessibility and responsive UI/UX.

Secure API keys and user location data using proper environment config practices.

Coding Style Preferences
General:

Use English for all naming (variables, components, files).

Write self-documenting code. Use comments for complex logic only.

Indentation:

Use 2 spaces for indentation (JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart).

No tabs.

Naming Conventions:

Use camelCase for variables and functions: currentWeather, fetchForecastData()

Use PascalCase for components and classes: WeatherCard, ForecastScreen

Use kebab-case for file names: weather-card.js, forecast-screen.dart

Constants: UPCOMING_DAYS, WEATHER_API_URL

Folder Structure (React Native example):

bash
Copy

/src
  /components
  /screens

ESLint + Prettier for code linting and formatting

Let me know if you're using a specific tech stack so I can tailor this more precisely (e.g., React Native vs Flutter).
